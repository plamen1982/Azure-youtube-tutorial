## Cloud Computing - Introduction

- Hosted services over the internet
- Infrastructure Services. - servers, scaling, security
- Software Services. - deploy
- Platforms Services. - tools, platforms and etc.

## Deployment Methods in the cloud

- public - open to the world
- private - used with credentials
- hybrid - both private and public access

## Physical vs Cloud Service

| Features                       | Physical Infrastructure               | Cloud Computing                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Cost                           | Generic Type                          | Special Type                                     |
| Troubleshooting Infrastructure | Difficult                             | Easy                                             |
| Downtime                       | Huge downtime                         | No Downtime                                      |
| Scalability                    | Servers gets idle on non traffic time | Scaled servers gets release in non traffic time. |
| Data Integrity                 | Difficult & Costly                    | Easy & Cheaper                                   |

- Cloud Computing - pay if your services work, no worries about anything(scalability, infrastructure, security, downtime, logs)
- Physical - you should hire skilled professionalist to take care of scalability, infrastructure, security, downtime, logs... very costly and easy a problem to occur

## Azure Cloud Computing

- What is Azure - Public Cloud service Provided by Microsoft
- Public Cloud service Providers: Google, Opentalk, VMWare, AWS...

## Azure - Why AZURE

- Greater Share in Market. - no worries that company will disappear
- Highest server Capacity servers.
- Pay as per use.

## Azure - Networks in Cloud Introduction

### Physical Networks

- Connect Pcs
- Public and Private Network
- Physical devices we use in networks

### How is Azure Networks?

- Virtual Network
- Connects Cloud infrastructure via virtual Network Called Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)

## VPC - Virtual Public Cloud

- Provision a logically isolated section of the Azure Networks
- Launch Azure resources in a virtual network
- COmplete control over your virtual networking

## VPC Features and Benefits

- Multiple Connectivity Options
  - Directly to internet (public subnets)
  - Internet using Network Address Translation (private subnets) - translate your private address to public
  - Connect securely to your corporate data center
  - VPCs- Peer VPCs together
  - Connect to Amazon S3
- Secure
- Simple
- Reliable
