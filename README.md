## Cloud Computing - Introduction

- Hosted services over the internet
- Infrastructure Services. - servers, scaling, security
- Software Services. - deploy
- Platforms Services. - tools, platforms and etc.

## Deployment Methods in the cloud

- public - open to the world
- private - used with credentials
- hybrid - both private and public access

## Physical vs Cloud Service

| Features                       | Physical Infrastructure               | Cloud Computing                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Cost                           | Generic Type                          | Special Type                                     |
| Troubleshooting Infrastructure | Difficult                             | Easy                                             |
| Downtime                       | Huge downtime                         | No Downtime                                      |
| Scalability                    | Servers gets idle on non traffic time | Scaled servers gets release in non traffic time. |
| Data Integrity                 | Difficult & Costly                    | Easy & Cheaper                                   |

- Cloud Computing - pay if your services work, no worries about anything(scalability, infrastructure, security, downtime, logs)
- Physical - you should hire skilled professionalist to take care of scalability, infrastructure, security, downtime, logs... very costly and easy to problem to occur
